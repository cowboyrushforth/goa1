goa1
======

OAuth v1.0 server helper.

Utilities to parse a http.Request and validate if the request is valid.

To parse a request:
<code>
goa1.ParseRequest(*http.Request) (*OAuthRequest, os.Error)
</code>

To validate a request:
<code>
goa1.Validate(*OAuthRequest, clientsecret string, tokensecret string) (bool, os.Error)
</code>

This package is not intended to be an "all-in-one" solution for an oauth v1.0 server.
Instead it will only help you validating a request.

The management of nonce, timestamp, access tokens, validation tokens, customer secrets,
and all that other stuff is not included here.
